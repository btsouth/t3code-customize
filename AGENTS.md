# Porting the patches to a new T3 Code nightly

These instructions are for a coding agent. A person can follow them too.

The patches in `patches/` are commits made against the upstream commit in
`patches/base.txt`. Upstream moves fast, so they often stop applying cleanly. Your job
is to carry them onto the user's nightly with every feature still working.

## Start

1. Run `python t3code-customize build` from this repo on Windows, or
   `python3 ./t3code-customize build` on Linux and macOS. It finds the installed
   application (AppImage, macOS app or Windows executable), reads its exact upstream
   commit, and applies the patches in the private source checkout. Use `--app` for a
   nonstandard installed path. The source checkout is `<cache>/t3code`; platform cache
   locations are in [README.md](README.md#good-to-know), and the build prints its log path.
2. If it reports a conflict, a rebase is stopped in that checkout. If it reports a
   failing test or typecheck, the commits are in place and the checks failed.

## Fix

Work only in that private source checkout and this repo.

- Conflicts: resolve each file, `git add` it, then `git -c core.editor=true rebase --continue`.
  Keep upstream's change and port the patch on top of it. When upstream moved or split
  a file, carry the change to the new location and follow the new APIs.
- Failing checks: fix the relevant commit with `git commit --fixup=<sha>`, then
  `git -c sequence.editor=true rebase -i --autosquash <nightly commit>`. Keep one
  commit per patch.
- If a test file moved upstream, update its path in `checks.json`.
- `git log <base>..<nightly commit>` and `git show` explain what changed upstream.
- To install dependencies, use exactly `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts`
  in the source checkout, the same as the tool.

Do not drop a patch, delete or weaken a test, or skip a check to get green. If a
feature can't be ported sensibly, stop and explain why.

## Finish

If `t3code-customize` started you, stop once the tests and typechecks in `checks.json`
pass (run them from the source checkout with `node_modules/.bin/vp test run <files>` and
`node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit -p <package>/tsconfig.json`). It continues the build itself.

Otherwise run the same Python entry with `build --resume`. It reruns the checks on the checkout as you
left it, builds, installs the result and writes the ported commits back to
`patches/`. Leave the checkout clean with no rebase in progress.

End with a short report: what changed upstream, what you changed and in which files,
and whether the final build succeeded. Separate fixture tests, native process
checks and real desktop startup evidence.
